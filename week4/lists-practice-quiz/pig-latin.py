# The permissions of a file in a Linux system are split into three sets of three permissions: read, write, and execute for the owner, group, and others. Each of the three values can be expressed as an octal number summing each permission, with 4 corresponding to read, 2 to write, and 1 to execute. Or it can be written with a string using the letters r, w, and x or - when the permission is not granted.
# For example: 
#  640 is read/write for the owner, read for the group, and no permissions for the others; converted to a string, it would be: "rw-r-----"
#  755 is read/write/execute for the owner, and read/execute for group and others; converted to a string, it would be: "rwxr-xr-x"
#  Fill in the blanks to make the code convert a permission in octal format into a string format.
